I will work with an application to be divided into two containers: one responsible for the Web part and another for the database.

I will do some tests with Kubernetes in our local machine to verify how the management of these containers that form our application works so that in the end we can take it to the production environment, Google Cloud.

I will create a cluster in Google Cloud, where we will have our application working perfectly, putting its IP address in the browser.
